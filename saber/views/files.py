"""This module provides a interface for uploading, viewing, and managing files
that can be processed by the chatbot. It handles file operations through the
chatbot's file storage system with proper error handling.

Supported File Types:
    - Text files (.txt)
    - PDF documents (.pdf)
    - Word documents (.docx)

Example Flow:
    1. User navigates to Files page
    2. Selects a file using the upload widget
    3. File is validated and stored via chatbot instance
    4. Success message displayed, file appears in management interface
    5. User can view uploaded files and optionally delete them

Note:
    This module requires the chatbot to be properly initialized in the session
    state. All configuration changes are applied immediately and persist
    throughout the session.
